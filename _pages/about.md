I am a postdoc at the [Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/vasiliki-vicky-bikia) and the [Daneshjou Lab](https://profiles.stanford.edu/roxana-daneshjou). My current work focuses on developing multimodal models to enhance biomarker identification and predict patient outcomes. I am also excited about developing patient-facing chatbots to help individuals better understand medical information. My overarching goal is to improve patient outcomes while making healthcare more accessible and effective for everyone.

I received my Advanced Diploma degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.auth.gr/en/home/) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Greece, in 2017, and my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, in 2021, respectively. During my Ph.D., I worked in the [Laboratory of Hemodynamics and Cardiovascular Technology](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lhtc/) at EPFL, under the mentorship of [Prof. Nikolaos Stergiopulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WTB0v3YAAAAJ&hl=en). My Ph.D. research addressed the clinical need for providing non-invasive tools for cardiovascular monitoring leveraging machine learning and physics-based numerical modeling.

<!-- Before joining HAI, I was part of the [Byers Center for Biodesign, Stanford](https://biodesign.stanford.edu) working together with Prof. Oliver Aalami, whose mentorship has essentially shaped my approach to digital healthcare innovation. I contributed to the Stanford Spezi, a framework designed to help you build your own digital health app including questionnaires, data collection from wearable devices, and integration with electronic health record systems. Especially, I designed and prototyped the [Spezi Data Pipeline tool](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziDataPipelineTemplate) for enhanced data accessibility and analysis workflows.  -->
