I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Byers Center for Biodesign, Stanford](https://biodesign.stanford.edu). I received my Advanced Diploma degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.auth.gr/en/home/) with honors from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Greece, in 2017, and my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Eengineering from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, in 2021, respectively. During my Ph.D., I worked in the [Laboratory of Hemodynamics and Cardiovascular Technology](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lhtc/) at EPFL, under the mentorship of Prof. Nikolaos Stergiopulos. My Ph.D. research addressed the clinical need for providing non-invasive tools for cardiovascular monitoring leveraging machine learning and physics-based numerical modeling. In particular, I developed and tested novel healthcare algorithms for major biomarkers including central blood pressure, stroke volume, left ventricular elastance and arterial stiffness. My work has resulted in over 30 scientific publications, patents, and several projects such as iFLOW, a non-invasive method for estimating stroke volume; CardioML, a machine learning pipeline for predicting aortic hemodynamics; and ELASTICITYDB, a synthetic dataset for cardiovascular analysis. My research has been supported by [Innosuisse - Swiss Innovation Agency](https://www.innosuisse.ch/inno/en/home.html), [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://www.snf.ch/en), and [Firmenich Foundation](https://www.firmenich.com).

My current role at Stanford has shaped my approach to digital healthcare innovation. I have been contributing to the Stanford Spezi, a framework designed to help you build your own digital health app including questionnaires, data collection from wearable devices, and integration with electronic health record systems. Especially, Iâ€™m designing and developing the [Spezi Data Pipeline tool](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziDataPipelineTemplate) for enhanced data accessibility and analysis workflows. It supports various HealthKit quantity types, allowing users to select, save and download data, apply filtering and statistical methods, and create visual representations. Additionally, my work has explored the clinical utility of smartwatches for arrhythmia detection in children and involved collaboration with major pharma companies to integrate physical activity data for personalized care strategies.

My research interests include health algorithms, digital biomarkers, machine learning, non-invasive monitoring, and physiological ageing. I am an active member of the wider academic communities, including IEEE, the Artery Society, and the European Network for Research in Vascular Ageing.
